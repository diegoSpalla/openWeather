# openWeather

- Detects available cities in DB table
- Starts to collect automatically information regarding temperature in these cities from OpenWeatherMapAPI

The application use PostgreSQL as a Database (with default settings), which code is available in the "src/main/resources" directory (postgresCode.sql)

The result could be visualized through a simple table in a web browser by reaching localhost address at port 8080 (tomcat default).

To start the application simply double-click on the JAR file generated by compilation (Maven is the default builder - POM.xml available in the main directory of the project)
